          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3">2) What We Provide</h2>
          <p>
            DoOrPay lets you create commitments with a monetary stake held in escrow, nominate a validator, submit proof, and route payouts automatically when tasks succeed or fail.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3">3) Eligibility & Accounts</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-5 space-y-2 text-slate-600">

          <ul className="list-disc ml-5 space-y-2 text-slate-600">
            <li>This deployment uses a simulated wallet for demonstration. Balances, stakes, and payouts are not real money and do not connect to a payment processor.</li>
            <li>Creators lock stake from their demo wallet before a task becomes active. Validators receive simulated payouts when outcomes are recorded.</li>
            <li>There is no real checkout, card capture, or bank transfer in this demo build.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3">5) Validators, Proof, and Outcomes</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-5 space-y-2 text-slate-600">
            <li>Creators must upload truthful proof before the deadline. Falsified proof may result in forfeiture and account action.</li>
            <li>Validators must review in good faith. Failure to review within the grace period may auto-release funds to the creator.</li>
            <li>We do not mediate factual disputes between users; our role is limited to payment routing based on declared outcomes.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3">6) Compliance and KYC</h2>
          <p>
            Razorpay may require KYC to enable payouts. You agree to provide accurate documents if requested. Lack of KYC can delay or block payouts.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-3">7) Prohibited Use</h2>
